# Drupal html5 base theme

Minimal html5 theme for Drupal. I use this theme on my Drupal projects:

## Use

You can create a [sub-theme](https://drupal.org/node/225125), or you can rather edit the theme directly with the following steps.

1. Download/Clone this repository
2. Create a folder with you theme name and move the files inside
3. Change the .info file with your theme name.
3. Edit the .info file as you need
5. Ready to develop!

Change/Upgrade all you need to adapt the theme to your needs

## Include

**css/Normalize.css:** Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing. [Read more](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
